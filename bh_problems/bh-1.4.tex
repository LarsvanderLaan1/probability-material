\begin{exercise}[BH.1.4]
\begin{solution}~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[] To find the number of games that are played, you could make a roster of players
		\begin{align*}
			\begin{array}{ccccc}
				&P_{1} & P_{2} &\ldots &P_{n}\\
				P_{1} & \times \\
				P_{2} & & \times \\
				\vdots&&&\ddots\\
				P_{n} & & & &\times\\
				\end{array}
		\end{align*}
		\item[(a)] Now find the number of elements in the lower triangular: $\frac{n^2-n}{2}$. Put these matches in a long line. Now each of the matches can results in a Win or a Loss (doesn't matter for which player). So we can make $2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}=2^{n\choose 2 }$ different strings of outcomes. Or you can see there are $n\choose 2$ combinations/game, for each combination/game there are 2 possible outcomes. 
	\item[(b)] See also (a), $n\choose 2$.
