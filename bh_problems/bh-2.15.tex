\begin{exercise}[BH.2.15]
\begin{solution}
	You want to maximize $P(A\cap B|I)$, so the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur given some information $I$. Now $I$ can be $A$, $B$, or $A\cup B$. By the definition of conditional probability
	\begin{align*}
		P(A\cap B|I) =\frac{P(A\cap B\cap I)}{P(I)} = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(I)}.
	\end{align*}
	Think about the second equality sign. In order to maximize this probability, you want to minimize $P(I)$. Given the ordering of the probabilities in the question, you would like to know $A$ occurred.
