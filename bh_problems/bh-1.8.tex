\begin{exercise}[BH.1.8]
\begin{solution}~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We need to set 221 steps, 110 are to the right and 111 are up. There are $N_{1}={221 \choose 111}$ ways to do so.
		\item Use the multiplication rule. From (a), there are $N_{1}={221 \choose 111}$ to get to (110,111). Then, there are $N_{2}={200 \choose 100}$ ways to get to $(210,211)$. In total, there are $N= N_{1}\cdot N_{2} = {221 \choose 111}\cdot {200 \choose 100}$ ways to complete the stated path.
	\end{enumerate}
