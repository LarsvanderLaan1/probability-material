\begin{exercise}[BH.3.17]
\begin{solution}
	There are enough seats if 100 or less people show up. Denote by $N$ the number of people who show up. We are looking for $P(N\leq 100)$. $N$ follows a binomial distribution (since each person shows up independently of the other), with parameters $n=110$ and $p=0.9$. Then,
	\begin{align*}
		P(N\leq 100) = \sum_{x=0}^{100}{110 \choose x}\cdot 0.9^{x}\cdot 0.1^{110-x} = 0.67.
	\end{align*}
	Probably a good idea not to calculate this by hand. In $R$, type \texttt{pbinom(100,110,0.9)}.
\end{solution}
