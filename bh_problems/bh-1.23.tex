\begin{exercise}[BH.1.23]
\begin{solution}
    Define by $A$ the event that buttons for 3 consecutive floors are pressed. Notice first that the first floor is the ground floor since this is an American book. There are in total $N_{T}=9^3$ different sets of preferences of the three persons. We get consecutive buttons if they want to go to floor $\{2,3,4\}$, $\{3,4,5\}$, $\{4,5,6\}$, $\ldots$, $\{8,9,10\}$. These are 7 options, but the order of these number is not relevant, so there are $N_{A}=7\cdot 3!$ options favorable to $A$. Using the naive definition of probability, we find that $$P(A) = \frac{N_{A}}{N_{T}} = \frac{7\cdot 3!}{9^3}.$$
