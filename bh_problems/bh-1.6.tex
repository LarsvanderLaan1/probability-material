\begin{exercise}[BH.1.6]
\begin{solution}
	Different solutions possible. The first player has 19 possible opponents and he can play white or black pieces, so $19\cdot 2$ options. The next player has 17 possible opponents and can again play with white or black pieces, so $17\cdot 2$ options. Continuing all the way down, we see that there are $N=(19\cdot 17\cdot 15\cdot\ldots\cdot 3\cdot 1)\cdot 2^{10}$ options.

	Alternatively, picture 10 boards with pieces already up. There are 20 seats for the players. There are therefore $20!$ arrangement possible. However, once seated, we can change the order of the boards + players. So we overcount by $10!$ and the total number of options is $N=\frac{20!}{10!}$.
