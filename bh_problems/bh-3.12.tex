\begin{exercise} [BH.3.12]
\begin{solution}~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Denote by $X$ the number of eyes of a fair die throw. Define $Y=X$ if $X\leq 2$ and $Y=2$ otherwise. 
		\item If the inequality is strict for some $x$, then we know that
		\begin{equation}
			\sum_{x}P(X=x)<\sum_{x}P(Y=y)
		\end{equation}
		However, summing over all outcomes should give 1 on the l.h.s. (left-hand side) and r.h.s. (right-hand side), so we have arrived at a contradiction. We conclude it is not possible to find discrete r.v.'s such that the stated inequality holds.
