\begin{exercise}[BH.1.38]
\begin{solution}~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Tyrion has 12 options to sit, for each of these 12 options, Cersei has 2 options, and for each of these, the remaining people at the table can be ordered in $10!$ ways. The total number of ways to order 12 people is $12!$, so defining the event that Tyrion and Cersei have adjacent seats as $A$, we have by the multiplication rule and the naive definition of probability,
			$$P(A) = \frac{12 \cdot 2\cdot 10!}{12!} = \frac{2}{11}.$$
		\item The only thing that matters is Cersei's choice. Wherever Tyrion sits, there are 2 out of 11 chairs Cersei can choose to sit next to Tyrion. So $P(A) = \frac{2}{11}$.
	\end{enumerate}
