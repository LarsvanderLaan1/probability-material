\begin{exercise} [BH.1.3]
\begin{solution}~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If no restaurant can be the same, then on Monday Fred has 10 options, on Tuesday Fred has 9 options, on Wednesday Fred has 8 options, etc. So in total, there are $N=10\cdot 9\ldots\cdot 6$ options.
		\item On Monday, Fred can choose 10 restaurants. Then on Tuesday, Fred only has 9 options, since he can't eat at the same restaurant as on Monday. On Wednesday, there are again 9 options, as the Monday restaurant is now fine, but the Tuesday restaurant is not. So we end up with $N=10\cdot 9^4$ options.
