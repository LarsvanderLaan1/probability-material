\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item It's annoying that we do not know whether Monty flipped Heads $H$ or Tails, so we are going to condition on this event.  
	
		Let $C_{i}$ be the event that the car is behind door $i$ and $G_{i}$ the event there is a goat behind door $i$. Denote by $D_j$ the event that Monty opens door $j$. We now apply the LOTP
		\begin{align*}
			P(C_{3}|D_{2},G_{2})& = P(C_{3}|H,D_{2},G_{2})P(H|D_{2},G_{2}) + P(C_{3}|H^{C},D_{2},G_{2})P(H^{C}|D_{2},G_{2})\\
			& = \frac{2}{3}\cdot P(H|D_{2},G_{2}) + P(C_{3}|H^{C},D_{2},G_{2})P(H^{C}|D_{2},G_{2})
		\end{align*}
		The second line uses the result from the standard Monty Hall problem that the probability of winning the car given the switching strategy is $2/3$. Now, we use the definition of conditional probability
		\begin{align*}
			P(C_{3}|H^{C},D_{2},G_{2}) &=\frac{P(D_{2},G_{2}|C_{3},H^{C})P(C_{3}|H^{C})}{P(D_{2},G_{2}|H^{C})}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{3}}=\frac{1}{2}.
		\end{align*}
		Here we used that $P(D_{2},G_{2}|C_{3},H^{C})=\frac{1}{2}$, since (1) if there is a car behind door 3, then there is a goat behind door 2, so $P(D_{2},G_{2}|C_{3},H^{C})=P(D_{2}|C_{3},H^{C})$ and (2) Monty is randomly opening one of the two doors, so $P(D_{2}|C_{3},H^{C})=P(D_{2}|H^{C})=\frac{1}{2}$. Also $P(C_{3}|H^{C})=P(C_{3})=\frac{1}{3}$, since the location of the car is independent of whether Monty opens doors at random or only opens doors with goats. Finally $P(D_{2},G_{2}|H^{C})=P(D_{2}|H^{C})P(G_{2}|H^{C})=\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3}$, since Monty randomly opens a door, this is independent of whether there is a goat there.

		The only unknown quantity that remains is
		\begin{align*}
			P(H|D_{2},G_{2})& = \frac{P(D_{2},G_{2}|H)P(H)}{P(D_{2},G_{2}|H)P(H)+P(D_{2},G_{2}|H^C)P(H^C)} \\
			&= \frac{(P(D_{2},G_{2}|C_{1},H)P(C_{1}|H)+P(D_{2},G_{2}|C_{3},H)P(C_{3}|H))P(H)}{P(D_{2},G_{2}|H)P(H)+P(D_{2},G_{2}|H^C)P(H^C)}\tag*{(LOTP)} \\
			&= \frac{(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3})p}{(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3})p+(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{3})(1-p)}
		\end{align*}
		where we used that $P(D_{2},G_{2}|C_{1},H)=\frac{1}{2}$ (if there is a car behind door 1, Monty decides between the two remaining doors with probability $\frac{1}{2}$). Also, $P(C_{1}|H)=P(C_{3}|H)=P(C_{1})=\frac{1}{3}$, and $P(D_{2},G_{2}|C_{3},H)=P(D_{2}|C_{3},H)=1$ (note that the term involving $C_{2}$ not appearing when applying the LOTP, why?). 

		Substituting all of this into the first equation of the answer gives
		\begin{align*}
			P(C_{3}|D_2,G_2) = \frac{1+p}{2+p}.
		\end{align*}
	\end{enumerate}
