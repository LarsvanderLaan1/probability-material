\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $H$ be the event that the man will hurt Stampy, let $L$ be the event that a man has lots of ivory, and let $D$ be the event that the man is an ivory dealer.
        \item Lisa observes that $L$ is true. She suggests (reasonably) that this evidence makes $D$ more likely, i.e., $P(D|L) > P(D)$. Implicitly, she suggests that this makes it likely that the man will hurt Stampy, i.e., $P(H|L) > P(H|L^C)$. Homer argues that $P(H|L) < P(H|L^C)$.
        \item Homer does not realize that observing that Blackheart has so much ivory makes it much more likely that Blackheart is an ivory dealer, which in turn makes it more likely that the man will hurt Stampy. This is an example of Simpsonâ€™s paradox. It may be true that, controlling for whether or not Blackheart is a dealer, having high ivory supplies makes it less likely that he will harm Stampy: $P(H|L, D) < P(H|L^C,D)$ and $P(H|L, D^C) < P(H|L^C,D^C)$. However, this does not imply that $P(H|L) < P(H|L^{C})$.
