\begin{hint}
	What happens if $A$ and $B$ are independent?
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}~
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We start with the definition of conditional probability.
		\begin{align*}
			P(B|A)& = \frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(A)}.
		\end{align*}
		Since $P(B|A)=1$, we have that $P(A) = P(B\cap A)$. We can split the event $A$ into the disjoint sets $B\cap A$ and $B^{C}\cap A$. Then, by the second Axiom of Probability
		\begin{align*}
			P(A) &= P(B\cap A) +P(B^{C}\cap A).
		\end{align*}
		Since  $P(A) = P(B\cap A)$, we infer that $P(B^{C}\cap A)=0$. Using again the definition of conditional probability
		\begin{align*}
			P(A|B^{C})=\frac{P(B^{c}\cap A)}{P(B^C)}.
		\end{align*}
		Since we found that $P(B^{C}\cap A)=0$, we see that $P(A|B^{C})=0$. Using that $P(A|B^{C}) + P(A^{C}|B^{C})=1$ (why?), we arrive at our conclusion that $P(A^{C}|B^{C})=1$. \newline\newline
		\textbf{Alternatively (thanks to Wietze Koops for suggesting this solution.)}\\
		Assume $P(B|A)=1$. Then, $P(B^{C}|A) = 1-P(B|A) = 0$. (The first equality [called the complement rule] follows from the conditional versions of the Axioms of Probability.)\\
		Hence, $P(A|B^C) = \frac{P(B^{C}|A)P(A)}{P(B^{C})} = 0$. (Bayes' rule)\\
		Hence, $P(A^{C}|B^{C}) = 1-P(A|B^{C}) = 1$. (Again the complement rule)
		\item  Suppose you throw two $n$ sided die (with $i$ eyes on the $i$th side for $i=1,\ldots,n$). Let $A$ be the event that the number of eyes on the first die is strictly smaller than $n$. Let $B$ be the event that the number of eyes of the second die is strictly smaller than $n$. Now, $P(B|A)=P(B) = \frac{n-1}{n}$, and $P(A^{C}|B^{C})=P(A^{C})=\frac{1}{n}$. The reason that this does not contradict (a) is in the requirement that the events $A$ and $B$ cannot have probability equal to 0 or 1. Suppose we change the events $A$ and $B$ to the number of eyes smaller or equal than $n$. Clearly $P(B|A)=P(B)=1$. However, $P(A^{C}|B^{C})=...$ not defined, because the definition of conditional probability requires $P(B^C)>0$.
