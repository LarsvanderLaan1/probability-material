\begin{exercise}[BH.1.31]
\begin{solution}
	After the first round, the are $n$ elk that have been captured. Suppose these are tagged. In the second round, we capture $m$ elk. Denote by $A_{k}$ the probability that exactly $k$ of these $m$ elk are tagged. The total number of ways to select $m$ elk is ${N \choose m}$. Selecting $k$ tagged elks and $m-k$ non-tagged elks can be done in ${n \choose k}\cdot {N-n \choose m-k}$ ways. Then, $$P(A_k) = \frac{{n \choose k}\cdot {N-n \choose m-k}}{{N \choose m}}.$$
