    \begin{solution}
        No, for example, we can pick $X=Z$. Compare the independence of three r.v.s. with the independence of three events and you will see if we want the three r.v.s to be independence we would need more than the independence between  $X$ and $Y$, and the independence between $Y$ and $Z$.
