Due to copyright issues, we could not include textbook exercises' main contexts but only a rough description of the original textbook exercise and its index. The index refers to the exercise section index from \textbf{[BH]}.\\~\\
\textbf{First} answer the original textbook exercise/ question \textbf{in your own words}, and \textbf{then} answer the additional questions modified based on the original textbook exercise\\~\\
Part of the exercises' solutions (\textbf{[BH]} exercises' solutions)  are provided in our course materials as references when you find exercises challenging but do not copy directly (otherwise, no points). \\~\\
